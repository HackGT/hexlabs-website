        <h3>Horizons</h3>
        <p>
          Horizons is an art-meets-tech makeathon, where the only limits are
          your imagination and time. Horizons is meant to be a place where
          participants can pursue their artistic endeavors and express
          themselves freely, using technology to widen the impact of their
          creations. At Horizons, participants will brainstorm, design, and
          create projects integrating art and technology, while attending
          workshops and mini-events.

        <p>
          BuildGT is a hardware focused hackathon that encourages students to
          focus on the physical aspects of hackathon projects, combining
          hardware and electronics with computer science. HexLabs offers a
          variety of resources, including hardware, to allow students to use
          hardware that they may not otherwise have access to. HexLabs makes an
          effort to partner with on-campus makerspaces on campus, like The Hive
          and the Invention Studio.
